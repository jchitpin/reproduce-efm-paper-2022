# Benchmarking EFM weights by cycle-history Markov chain versus optimization-based methods

This repository contains the scripts necessary to regenerate all figures and
results from the manuscript by J. G. Chitpin and T. J. Perkins.

## Hardware requirements

Any architecture that can run the Julia programming language.


## Software requirements

The following is required:

* Julia (minimum version 1.6).
* A Bash terminal to run the scripts/workflows.
* TeX distribution (like TeX Live or MiKTeX) to compile figures.

## Installation

Download the repository and install all necessary Julia packages by running

`cd `
`$ julia `

## Workflow to reproduce results

The scripts in the following subsections must be run in order to regenerate
the intermediate data files.

### Figure 1 and 2


### Figure 3


### Figure 4
